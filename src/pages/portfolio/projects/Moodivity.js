			<Paragraph content="Everybody struggles with the stresses of everyday life, and for the most part, mental health is sacrificed for productivity. This quickly leads individuals down a vicious cycle of being unproductive and overwhelmed because of their deteriorating mental health and wellbeing." />
			<Paragraph content="With Moodivity, users can create a profile, set daily goals for themselves, and have access to different activities linked to the work they will be doing. They can then start their daily work, and time themselves as they do so. Once they are finished for the day, they are prompted to record an audio log to reflect on the work completed throughout the day." />
			<Paragraph content="These logs are then transcribed and analyzed using powerful Machine Learning models and saved to the database so that users can reflect on days they did better or worse, and how their sentiment reflected that." />
